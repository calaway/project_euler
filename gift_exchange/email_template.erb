Merry Christmas <%= from %>!

I wrote an application that has drawn names for everybody participating our Christmas gift drawing and has also composed this lovely email to you. Below you will find the two people you have drawn to buy gifts for. You will also see the other person who also drew the same recipient so you can coordinate with them to either go-in on a larger gift together or just contact them to make sure you don't both buy the same gift for that person.

<%= from %>, the names you drew are:
<%= to.first %> (<%= counterpart.first %> also drew <%= to.first %>)
<%= to.last %> (<%= counterpart.last %> also drew <%= to.last %>)
